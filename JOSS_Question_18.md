...and its teleomorphs were discussed in a separate paper, while the recommendations of an international panel are included. Additionally, the polyphasic methods applied recently on aspergilli resulted in four monographs included in this issue: Aspergillus sections Candidi, Clavati, Fumigati and Usti. Diagnostic tools developed for the identification of the economically extremely important but taxonomically problematic black aspergilli (Aspergillus section Nigri) are also covered in a separate paper. This issue contains many colour illustrations, particularly in the four monographs....

...INTRODUCTION

The genus Aspergillus contains some of the most abundant and widely distributed organisms on earth, and comprises approxi- mately 350 accepted species (Samson et al. 2014). It is one of the fungal genera with the highest economic importance in biotechnology (enzymes, organic acids, bioactive metabolites), the genus are also frequently reported as but members of foodborne contaminants (food spoilage and mycotoxin contam- ination), or as causal agents of human mycoses (pulmonary aspergillosis, otomycosis, keratitis). Aspergillus is also one of the oldest names in fungal taxonomy since it was applied by Micheli (1729), who gave it this name because the spore-bearing structure characteristic of the genus resembled an aspergillum (a device used by the Catholic church to sprinkle holy water). However this morphological characteristic resulted in a broad generic concept because it is associated to twelve quite different...

...Practical laboratory guides for identification of common Aspergilli which are primarily based on morphology and colony characters have been published by Tzean et al. (1990), Klich (2002), and Pitt & Hocking (2009). Many books have been published on Aspergillus of which that of Machida & Gomi (2010) is the most recent. However, note that the taxonomic schemes used in these publications are out of date.
