# Question 4

**Question:** Is the name Eurotium still in use?

## Generated Answers (20 responses)

### Answer 1

Although the paper collection discusses the transition from using Eurotium to Aspergillus for classification and naming, it doesn't explicitly state whether the name Eurotium is no longer in use.

However, according to Pitt (1980) mentioned in the papers, Eurotium species are still able to grow on low water activity products, making them important food spoilage organisms. This suggests that the name Eurotium might still be used in specific contexts or research studies related to these fungi.

Additionally, some species names, such as Eurotium amstelodami and E. repens, are mentioned in the papers as synonyms of Aspergillus species. However, this does not necessarily mean that the name Eurotium is no longer valid or used for those specific species.

In summary, while the single-name system for Aspergillus has become more widely adopted, it's possible that some researchers and scientists may still use the name Eurotium in certain contexts, especially when referring to specific species or studies related to these fungi.

### Answer 2

Based on the provided research papers, it appears that the name Eurotium is no longer used as a separate genus. According to Hubka et al. (2013), who applied the single-name system for the revision of the genus Eurotium and transferred all Eurotium species to their Aspergillus names.

However, some older references still use the name Eurotium, such as Pitt's monograph (1980) and a few specific species are mentioned with this name, like Eurotium amstelodami. 

In general, it seems that Eurotium is no longer used as a distinct genus, but its names may still be found in older literature or databases.

---

### Answer 3

According to Hubka et al. (2013), who applied the single-name system for the revision of the genus Eurotium, all Eurotium species were transferred to their Aspergillus names.

Additionally, Pitt and Taylor's proposal (2016) suggests that for approximately 180 species with unknown sexual morphs, the use of originally teleomorph-typed genus names should be enforced, but it does not necessarily imply that Eurotium is no longer used as a synonym. However, in most recent studies and taxonomies, the Aspergillus name seems to be more widely adopted.

It appears that the name Eurotium is still recognized in some contexts, particularly for older or less well-studied species. Nevertheless, it is generally recommended that Aspergillus names be used instead of Eurotium names, especially for newly described species or those with uncertain sexual morphs.

Therefore, while the use of Eurotium might decline over time, it's still possible to find references to this name in scientific literature, particularly in older studies or for specific species.

---

### Answer 4

According to Hubka et al. (2013) and other studies, the single-name system has been adopted for the revision of the genus Eurotium, and all accepted Eurotium taxa are listed under their Aspergillus names.

However, Pitt & Taylor (2016) proposed a new approach that would enforce the use of originally teleomorph-typified genus names for approximately 180 species with unknown sexual morphs. This proposal is still being discussed in the scientific community, but it's not widely adopted yet.

In general, while the name Eurotium is no longer used as a distinct genus, its type species (e.g., Eurotium cristatum) and other names derived from Eurotium are still recognized within the Aspergillus genus.

So, to answer your question, the name Eurotium is not commonly used in modern taxonomic literature, but some older names and types are still recognized and used within the Aspergillus genus.

---

### Answer 5

Based on the research paper snippets provided, it appears that the name Eurotium is no longer used as a separate genus, but rather all species classified under this name have been transferred to their Aspergillus names. This change was recommended by Hubka et al. (2013) and has been adopted in the recently published Aspergillus taxonomies.

However, it seems that some older literature still mentions Eurotium, such as Pitt's monograph from 1980 and a few specific species' classifications. Nevertheless, for most recent studies and applications, Aspergillus is used instead of Eurotium, possibly due to the overwhelming citation frequency of Aspergillus over Eurotium (e.g., Aspergillus was cited 64,191 times, while Eurotium was cited 493 times).

In summary, while some older literature may still mention Eurotium, it appears that the name is no longer used as a separate genus and has been largely replaced by Aspergillus in modern taxonomic studies.

### Answer 6

Yes, the name Eurotium is still used. 

While the paper states that the single-name system is being adopted for genera like Aspergillus (which includes many species formerly known as Eurotium), the  research papers continue to use the name Eurotium, especially when referring to groups of related species. 

Let me know if you have other questions!

---

### Answer 7

Yes, the name Eurotium is still in use.  The papers indicate that it remains in use for multiple species despite attempts to standardize naming under "Aspergillus."

---

### Answer 8

Yes, the name Eurotium is still used. 

The provided text discusses its classification and uses:

* **Eurotium species:** These are described as belonging to the genus Eurotium, which is a diverse group of fungi.  
* **Examples:** The paper mentions Eurotium amstelodami and E. repens. 
* **Synonyms:**  Several synonyms for the species Eurotium have been proposed or recognized.

The scientific community continues to use the name "Eurotium" in their research and publications.

---

### Answer 9

Yes, the name Eurotium is still in use. 

While there has been a push to use the "Aspergillus" genus for species with unknown sexual states (as proposed by Pitt & Taylor), the paper collection provided shows that the name "Eurotium"  is still used and cited. 

Let me know if you have other questions about this!

---

### Answer 10

Yes, the name Eurotium is still in use.  The papers mention it frequently and include some information about species that were formerly classified under the Eurotium genus. 

Let me know if you have any other questions!

---

### Answer 11

Based on the information provided in the papers, the name Eurotium is no longer used as a separate genus. Instead, all species that were previously classified under the Eurotium genus have been transferred to their Aspergillus names through the single-name system proposed by Hubka et al. (2013). Therefore, the name Eurotium is not in use for any of these genera at present.

---

### Answer 12

Based on the information provided in the research papers, the genus Eurotium is no longer used independently. According to Hubka et al. (2013), all Eurotium species were transferred under their Aspergillus names as part of a single-name system for the revision of the genus Eurotium. Therefore, the name Eurotium is not in use by itself and has been replaced by corresponding Aspergillus species names.

---

### Answer 13

Based on the information provided in the research snippets, it seems that the name Eurotium is no longer commonly used for species. The studies indicate that Eurotium species have been transferred to the genus Aspergillus under a single-name system. This means that instead of keeping separate names for these species, they are now all referred to within the larger Aspergillus category. Therefore, while the name "Eurotium" might still appear in older literature or taxonomic works, it is not commonly used for new identifications or classifications.

---

### Answer 14

Based on the information provided in the snippets, it seems that the genus Eurotium is no longer used as a distinct taxonomic entity. The single-name system for the revision of the genus Eurotium suggests that all Eurotium species were transferred to their Aspergillus name. This change indicates that the name "Eurotium" itself is not being used, and its usage has been replaced by referring to the corresponding Aspergillus species instead.

---

### Answer 15

Based on the information provided in the papers, it seems that the name Eurotium is no longer commonly used. The studies mentioned suggest that the single-name system for the genus Eurotium has been applied, where all species previously classified under Eurotium have been transferred to their Aspergillus names. This indicates a change from using Eurotium as a separate genus to incorporating its species into the broader Aspergillus genus framework. Therefore, the name Eurotium may be considered obsolete or at least less commonly used in modern taxonomic classifications of these genera.

---

### Answer 16

The scientific papers indicate that the name Eurotium has been phased out as an independent genus. Instead, all previously recognized Eurotium species have been classified under their respective Aspergillus names due to the adoption of a single-name system and the teleomorph-based classification. Therefore, the name Eurotium is not in current use.

**Answer:**  
No, the name Eurotium is not in current scientific use; all previously recognized Eurotium species are now classified under their respective Aspergillus names as part of the single-name system.

---

### Answer 17

Based on the provided information from scientific papers, the genus *Eurotium* is no longer in active use. Instead, its species have been transferred and classified under the broader genus *Aspergillus*. This change reflects ongoing taxonomic updates and the adoption of single-name systems that integrate previously distinct genera into a more comprehensive classification framework.

**Answer:**
No, the name Eurotium is not currently in use. Its species are now part of the genus Aspergillus under current taxonomic practices.

---

### Answer 18

The name Eurotium is no longer in active use. Its species have been transferred to the genus Aspergillus under the single-name system, as supported by recent taxonomic studies and literature. This integration reflects the ongoing evolution of fungal taxonomy, with teleomorphic names like Eurotium being replaced by more universally applicable genera such as Aspergillus.

---

### Answer 19

The name "Eurotium" has been reclassified and synonymized under the genus "Aspergillus." Species previously designated as Eurotium are now included in the Aspergillus classification, indicating that Eurotium is no longer in use.

---

### Answer 20

The name Eurotium is no longer in use; it has been retired and integrated into the genus Aspergillus through a single-name system. Species previously classified under Eurotium are now recognized as separate species within Aspergillus based on recent phylogenetic studies, particularly using SEM analysis. The transfer of Eurotium to Aspergillus underscores its importance in current taxonomy and replaces its usage with the more comprehensive genus name. 

Answer: No, the name Eurotium is not currently used; it has been retired and replaced by Aspergillus species within the same classification framework.

...Throughout the history of these genera, the way we describe species has evolved, bringing with it many taxonomic changes. The one thing that has remained is the community of collaborators who have adhered to best practises and worked together to create a standard for Eurotiales that serves everyone and provides a solid taxonomic basis for the study of these species. We believe that our recommendations will help to expand this community and provide further stability to the taxonomy of Eurotiales.

...Eurotiales is one of the most diverse orders of fungi and includes genera such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Paecilomyces and Talaromyces. Species identification in these speciose genera has been very difficult in the past. Recent taxonomic and nomenclatural studies have modernised the morphology-based classifications to the extent that these genera now have one of the most modern taxonomies of all fungi. The basis and main driving force for this are the so-called ‘accepted species lists’. Nomenclators such as MycoBank (https://www.mycobank.org/) list more than 3 000 names of Eurotiales. However, many of these names belong to other genera, were considered synonyms of accepted species, or remain unrecognisable because old descriptions were insufficient for recognition and/or no material is available. Knowledge of a genus at a given time was traditionally published in monographs that contained descriptions for all species and keys for their identification. Pitt (1980), in his monograph...

Kozakiewicz (1989) focused on scanning electron microscope (SEM) examinations of conidia and ascospores in her treatment of the group. Based on conidial ornamentations, four conidial morphotypes were identiﬁed, namely aculeate, tuberculate, lobate-reticulate and microtuberculate. Within each group, characters of equatorial crests, furrow and convex wall orna- mentation are important diagnostic features. It was shown that some species previously considered conspeciﬁc according to light microscopy, e.g. A. cristatus (= Eurotium cristatum) and A. intermedius (= E. intermedium), show distinct conidial orna- mentation in SEM and deserve to be recognized as separate species (Kozakiewicz 1989).
