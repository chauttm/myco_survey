### Answer 2

I found some information on how different species within the Penicillium series Viridicata differ from each other.

According to the research paper "Taxonomic classification of the largest section of subgenus Penicillium, sect. Viridicata" (Hallas-Moller et al., 2018), species within this series can be differentiated based on various characteristics such as colony morphology, conidiophore shape, and extrolite profiles.

For example:

* P. tricolor and P. melanoconidium are distinguished by their unique extrolite profiles, with P. tricolor producing a specific type of viridicatin.
* P. polonicum is characterized by its broad, flat conidia that are typically longer than they are wide.
* P. cyclopium has a distinctive, star-shaped pattern on its conidiophores, which is not observed in other species within the series.
* P. aurantio- griseum and P. viridicatum are distinguished by their unique extrolite profiles, with P. viridicatum producing a specific type of viridamine.

Additionally, some research papers (e.g., Frisvad & Samson, 2004b) mention that species within the Penicillium series Viridicata can be differentiated based on their growth patterns and production of specific extrolites. However, it is worth noting that many of these characteristics can vary between different strains and isolates, making identification challenging.

Overall, while some differences are observed between species within the Penicillium series Viridicata, there is a significant degree of variation and overlap among them, highlighting the complexities of taxonomy in this group.

### Answer 3

Based on the provided research papers, here are some key differences between Penicillium series Viridicata species:

1. Colony texture and growth: Different species in series Viridicata have varying colony textures, such as velvety (P. viridicatum), granular or velvety (P. tricolor), or floccose (P. polonicum).
2. Conidiophore morphology: The conidiophores of different species differ, with some being terverticillate (P. neoechinulatum) and others being biverticillate (P. virgatum) or monoverticillate (P. longicatenatum).
3. Conidium shape and size: The conidia of various species in series Viridicata have different shapes, such as ellipsoidal or globose to sub-globose (P. tricolor), or globose (P. polonicum) with distinct roughening.
4. Extrolite production: Different species produce varying extrolites, including viridicatins, cyclopenins, fructigenines, and others. Some species, like P. virgatum, do not produce any specific extrolite mentioned in the papers.
5. Temperature sensitivity: Some species are more temperature-sensitive than others, with some growing poorly or restrictedly at 37°C (P. longicatenatum).
6. Sclerotia formation: Some species, such as P. vagum, form sclerotia, while others, like P. viridicatum, do not.
7. Phylogenetic relationships: The phylogenetic analysis shows that different species in series Viridicata are grouped differently, with some forming clades together (e.g., P. tricolor and P. freii) and others forming distinct subclades (e.g., P. melanoconidium and P. polonicum).

These differences highlight the polythetic nature of series Viridicata, where multiple characters can be used to distinguish between species, rather than relying on a single defining feature.

Note that this summary is based on a limited set of papers and might not represent all species in series Viridicata. Further research would be needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the differences between these species.

### Answer 5

Based on the provided research papers, here are some key differences between species in the Penicillium series Viridicata:

1. Conidial shape and size: Species in this series have ellipsoidal or globose conidia that range in size. For example:
	* P. tricolor has conidia that are 2-3 μm long.
	* P. freii has conidia that are 2-4 μm long.
	* P. neoechinulatum has conidia that are 1.8-2.5 μm long, with a more subglobose shape.
	* P. viridicatum has conidia that are ellipsoidal to subglobose, smooth or very finely roughened (except echinulate in P. neoechinulatum).
2. Colony texture and growth: The colony textures of species in this series vary:
	* P. tricolor, P. freii, and P. melanoconidium have colonies with a velvety to floccose texture.
	* P. viridicatum has colonies with a granular or velvety texture.
3. Extrolite production: Different species in this series produce varying types of extrolites:
	* Some species, like P. aurantiogriseum and P. cyclopium, produce 4-hydroxy-3,6-dimethyl-2H-pyran-2-one, penicillic acids, cyclopenins/viridicatins, fructigenines/puberulines, and verrucosidins.
	* Other species, like P. tricolor, produce Andrastin A.
4. Growth on CREA: Some species in this series have varying growth patterns on CREA:
	* P. viridicatum has weak to moderate growth on CREA.
	* P. melanoconidium and P. polonicum have poor growth on CREA.

These differences contribute to the polythetic nature of the Penicillium series Viridicata, meaning that no single characteristic is present in all species, but rather a combination of characteristics defines each species within the group.

### Answer 6

The provided text outlines several ways in which *Penicillium* species within the *viridicata* series differ:

**1. Phylogeny:**  Analysis using multigene phylogenies shows clear relationships within the series, leading to divisions into three clades (subclades) based on strong bootstrap support. 
    - Example: One clade includes *P. viridicatum*, *P. tricolour* , *P. freii*, and others. This group is distinct from *P. melanoconidium*.

**2. Extrolites:**  These are specific chemical compounds produced by the fungi. They can be used to differentiate species:
    - **Verrucosa:** Many species in this series produce verruculones and ochra-toxins. 
    -  **Viridicata:** A more diverse set of extrolites (including anacines, alantrypinones, burnettienes, daldinin D, fumiquinazolines, lumpidin, pyranonigrins, sclerotigenin, verrucins and viridic acid).

**3. Micromorphology:**  The visual features of the fungi are significant:
    - **Color:** The colonies often exhibit shades of green (greyish, dull, or dark), with conidia being en masse in those shades. 
    - **Texture:**  Can range from velvety to flocccose.

**4. Growth and Temperature Sensitivity:** Some species have restricted growth under certain conditions, especially at 37°C.

**In summary:** The *viridicata* series is very diverse. It contains distinct clades with unique features in terms of their phylogeny, chemical compounds (extrolites), morphology (microscopic features) and even temperature requirements for growth. This diversity makes it a significant part of the *Penicillium* genus.

### Answer 10

Here's how the Penicillium series Viridicata species differ, based on the research papers you provided:

**Key Distinctions:**

* **Phylogeny:**  The most important distinction is their phylogenetic relationships. The three series within series Viridicata are related to each other, but they branch off in different ways:
    * **Series Viridicata (subgen. Penicillium, sect. Fasciculata):** This is the largest and most diverse.  It contains many species with overlapping characteristics, but these species show clear relationships based on their genetic makeup.  
    * **Series Camemberti:**  This series has a very distinct, robust group of species (like *P. camemberti*) that are easily distinguished by their specific morphology.
    * **Series Verrucosa:**  This is another large and diverse group, similar to Series Viridicata in the number of distinct species. 

**Morphological Differences:**

* **Colony texture & appearance:** The research describes how these series have different textures (velvet, flocccose) and color patterns (green to dark brown).
* **Conidia (spores):** The shape and roughness of conidia are important for identification. Some species are smooth, others may be rough, and that varies within the same genus. 

**Extrolites:**
Penicillium series Viridicata produce a range of secondary metabolites (extrolites) with unique chemical structures. These substances vary in their production across these series:
* **Verrucosidins & Others:**  Many species are associated with grain, but there are also differences in the extrolites produced. For example, Verrucosa has distinct toxins like verruculones and ochra-toxins, while others may have anacines or other compounds that aren't found in all series.

**Overall:**
* The series Viridicata is known for its high species diversity with a lot of overlap in characteristics. This makes the identification process more challenging.

### Answer 11

Based on the provided research snippets, there isn't a direct comparison or description of how individual species within the series Penicillium viridicatum (series Viridicata) differ from each other. The snippets primarily provide information about various morphological and physiological characteristics as well as some aspects related to their phylogenetic relationships and extrolite profiles, but do not specifically detail differences between specific species within the series.

For a more precise answer, you would need additional data or studies focusing on comparisons among individual species within series Viridicata. The available information suggests that while they share some characteristics (such as forming colonies with granular or velvety textures), there is also variability in their growth patterns and colony textures, which could indicate differences between species.

To get the most accurate answer, it would be best to consult more detailed studies focused on individual species within series Viridicata.

---

### Answer 12

Based on the provided research snippets, the Penicillium series Viridicata includes a diverse group of species with various morphological and physiological characteristics:

1. **Morphology & Physiology**: 
   - Colony texture can vary significantly (e.g., growing moderately fast or restricted; colony texture can be granular, velvety, or flaccose).
   - Conidiophore arrangement can differ (terverticillate vs biverticillate with additional branches).
   - Conidia shape and wall characteristics (e.g., ellipsoidal/ globose to subglobose; smooth/rugged walls) can be distinct.
   - Growth on CREA varies in quality and rate.

2. **Extrolites**: 
   - Several species produce specific metabolites like anacine, aspermytin A/peniantiogriseols, aspermytic acid, asteltoxin, auranthine, aurantiomides, viridamine, brevianamide A, 4-(9-hydroxy-10-butynoxy) benzoic acid/penipratynolenes.
   - Other species produce verruculones and ochratoxins, among other metabolites.

3. **Phylogenetic Classification**: 
   - Series Viridicata is divided into clades based on multigene phylogenies (Fig. 2). One of the largest clades includes several species like P. tricolor, P. freii, P. neoechinulatum, and P. viridicatum.
   - The series can be monophyletic in some analyses but not others; for instance, Fig. 1 shows a monophyletic group based on consensus (86% bootstrap support), while Fig. 2 divides the species into three subclades supported by strict consensus.

4. **Polythetic Series Characteristics**:
   - The series Viridicata is noted to be polythetic regarding extrolites, meaning no metabolite is shared among all species in this series.

However, specific details about how individual members of the series differ from each other are not elaborated upon in the provided snippets. The general theme is that there is significant diversity within series Viridicata, reflected in differences at various taxonomic levels such as morphological and physiological features, extrolite profiles, and phylogenetic relationships.

---

### Answer 13

Based on the provided information, there isn't a comprehensive comparison or detailed description of how individual species within the series Viridicata differ from each other in terms of their morphological and physiological characteristics. The available papers discuss phylogenetic relationships and some general traits for the series as a whole rather than specific differences between species.

For example:

1. There are several references to different extrolites produced by these species, but this is not detailed enough to compare how each species within the series differs.
2. Series descriptions mention typical colony textures (e.g., velvety or floccose), conidiophore types (biverticillate vs monoverticillate), and conidia morphology (globose vs subglobose, smooth vs rough-walled).
3. Some species are described as forming specific metabolites like penicillic acid, verrucosin, viridicatins, or other compounds.

However, for precise information on how individual species within the series Viridicata differ from each other in terms of colony coloration, growth habits, conidiophore structure, and physiological traits, additional detailed descriptions would be required. The available papers provide a broad overview but do not go into enough detail to distinguish between specific species within the series.

---

### Answer 14

The provided research snippets do not contain direct information about how individual species within the series Viridicata differ from each other in specific phenotypic or morphological features. The papers focus on phylogenetic relationships, extrolite profiles, and general taxonomic classifications rather than detailed comparisons between species.

However, based on previous findings mentioned in these snippets:

- Different colonies can have different growth rates (e.g., moderately fast vs. restricted)
- Colony texture varies among species
- Conidiophores may differ in morphology or branching patterns
- Conidia size and wall structure can be distinct 
- Some species produce specific extrolites while others do not

For example, P. viridicatum is described as having colonies that grow moderately fast, colony textures are granular or velvety; conidiophores terverticillate with growth on CREA (Crude Essimental for Raising Eumycotic Antifungals) showing weak to moderate growth and no base production. 

P. virgatum has colonies that are restricted in size, colony texture is typically velvety or floccose, conidiophores biverticillate with additional branches. Conidia are described as globose to subglobose, smooth.

Given the phylogenetic information provided about these series Viridicata species being divided into three clades within section Viridicata and having distinct extrolite profiles, it can be inferred that there are differences between individual species in these characteristics. However, for precise detailed comparisons of specific differences among all species in this series, more specialized literature or a more comprehensive analysis would be necessary.

---

### Answer 15

Based on the information provided, the main differences among Penicillium series Viridicata species appear to be in their morphology and extrolite profiles. The research discusses how some species within this section form distinct phylogenetic groups or subclades based on multigene phylogenies.

For example:
- Penicillium viridicatum forms a monophyletic group with other species including P. tricolor, P. freii, P. neoechinulatum, and P. aurantiogriseum.
- There are at least three distinct subclades within the series Viridicata based on some multigene phylogenies.
- Penicillium virgatum is distinguished from other Viridicata species by having a different extrolite profile.

However, it's important to note that not all differences in morphology or extrolites are mentioned for every species comparison. The document also notes the presence of multiple extrolite profiles among these species and suggests this diversity might be due to evolutionary divergence within the section Viridicata.

Without more detailed phylogenetic studies or taxonomic analyses, it's challenging to specify all possible differences between specific series Viridicata species with certainty based solely on the provided information. For a comprehensive understanding of species variability within series Viridicata, additional research would be required.

     1. A large clade containing P. tricolor, P. freii, P. neoechinulatum, P. viridicatum, and P. aurantiogriseum.
     2. Penicillium melanoconidium forms its own clade without strong support.
     3. Penicillium polonicum and Penicillium cyclopium belong to another group with weak support.

2. **Morphological Features:**
   - **Colony Texture:** Most species have a velvety or ﬂoccose texture, with some variations among clades.
   - **Conidophores:** These vary in structure; some are biverticillate, while others are smooth.
   - **Conidia:** Conoids show variation from globose to subglobose, often with distinct roughness.

3. **Extrolites:**
   - Each species produces unique extrotiles contributing to their identification:
     - Penicillium tricolor and others in the large clade produce specific acids and cyclic compounds.
     - P. melanoconidium has its own distinct set of extrotiles, indicating uniqueness within its clade.

These differences highlight how species within Penicillium Viridicata form distinct groups with specific morphological traits and chemical profiles, contributing to their classification as distinct species.

---

### Answer 18

The Penicillium species within the Viridicata series exhibit distinct differences based on morphological and physiological traits:

1. **Penicillium viridicatum**: Characterized by biverticillate conidophores, moderately fast-growing colonies with velvety or ﬂoccose textures, and globular to subglobose conidia that are rough-walled but do not produce acid on CREA.

2. **Penicillium neoechinulatum**: Similar to viridicatum in colony characteristics, likely sharing broader morphological features with it within the Viridicata clade.

3. **Penicillium tricolor**: Part of a monophyletic clade supported by 100% bootstrap support along with P. freii, P. neoechinulatum, and P. aurantio-griseum. It has unique sequences within this group, suggesting specific morphological or physiological differences.

4. **Penicillium melanoconidium**: Exists as a separate clade without significant support, indicating distinct characteristics not shared by others in the series.

5. **Penicillium freii and Penicillium polonicum/cyclopium**: Members of another subclade with P. thymicola, potentially sharing specific features but differing from tricolor and melanoconidium based on morphological or extrolite-specific differences.

The series Viridicata is divided into three subclades:
- Subclade 1: Includes P. tricolor, P. freii, P. neoechinulatum, and P. viridicatum with strong support.
- Subclade 2: Features P. melanoconidium as a separate clade.
- Subclade 3: Contains P. thymicola and P. cyclopium with less distinct characteristics.

Differences among species likely manifest in morphological traits such as colony growth, texture, conidium shape, and extrolite composition, each contributing to their unique placement within or outside broader clades.

---

### Answer 19

The Penicillium species within the Viridicata series exhibit significant variation in both morphological features and genetic relationships:

1. **Morphological Differences**:
   - **Penicillium viridicatum**: Colonies grow moderately fast, with a velvety texture; conidophores are biverticillate and smooth.
   - **Penicillium freii** and **Penicillium neoechinulatum**: These species share identical genetic sequences, suggesting close phylogenetic relationships.
   - **Other Species in Viridicata**: Include Penicillium tricolor, Penicillium melanoconidium, Penicillium polonicum, among others. Some show unique sequences and form distinct subclades with varying bootstrap supports.

2. **Genetic Relationships**:
   - The series is divided into three monophyletic clades: one strongly supported (87% BS) including P. tricolor and P. melanoconidium; another with moderate support (83%) containing P. polonicum; and a third unresolved group.
   - Penicillium viridicatum is part of the most supported subclade.

3. **Extrolites**:
   - Many species produce similar extrolites, such as penicillic acids or cyclopenins. Notably, P. tricolor and P. polonicum produce a dark brown halo on Raulin-Thom agar, aiding in their identification.

In summary, the Viridicata series within Penicillium shows diversity through morphological traits like colony growth and texture, as well as genetic distinctions that place some species into distinct clades with varying levels of support.

**Chemical Differences:**
1. **Extrolites Produced:** Each species produces unique compounds such as 4-hydroxy-3,6-dimethyl-2H-pyran-2-one, penicillic acids, and others, aiding in their differentiation.
2. **Specific Extrolites:** Species like P. tricolor, P. freii, and P. viridicatum have been identified for specific metabolites, contributing to their taxonomic distinctiveness.

These morphological and chemical differences collectively help distinguish the various species within the Penicillium Viridicata series.

...Type: Penicillium viridicatum Westling, Ark. Bot. 11: 88. 1911.

Diagnosis: Phylogeny: Series Viridicata belongs to subgen. Penicillium, sect. Fasciculata and forms a clade with series Camembertiorum, Corymbifera and Verrucosa. Morphology & physiology: Colonies growing moderately fast, colony texture granular or velvety; co- nidiophores terverticillate; rough-walled, growth on CREA weak to moderate, no base production; conidia ellipsoidal or globose to sub- globose, smooth or very ﬁnely roughened (except echinulate in P. neoechinulatum). Sexual morph unknown; sclerotia not observed in culture. Many species in ser. Viridicata are associated with stored cereal grains. Series Viridicata is a typical example of a polythetic series regarding extrolites as no metabolite is shared among all species (Frisvad & Samson 2004b, Hallas-Moller et al. 2018). Most species produce a dark brown halo on Raulin-Thom agar (Frisvad & Samson 2004b)....

...analyses suggested that sect. Viridicata, the largest section in the subgenus, is divided into three clades. Section Viridicata ser. Viridicata formed a monophyletic group divided into three subclades supported by strict consensus, with strong bootstrap support for P. tricolor (100%), P. melanoconidium (99%), P. polonicum (87%) and P. cyclopium (99%) and moderate support for P. aurantiogriseum (79%). The three strains each of Penicillium freii and P. neoechinulatum had identical sequences. Three strains of P. viridicatum had unique sequences, with two strains differing in two or three positions from the type. Within ser. Camemberti, P. palitans (83%) and P. crustosum (99%) were supported by bootstrap. Penicillium camemberti and P. caseifulvum had identical sequences to each other, and to the type strain of P. commune. Section Viridicata ser. Verrucosa was monophyletic and included two well-supported subclades, one consisting of P. thymicola (87%), and the other of P. verrucosum (88%),...

...Section Viridicata The phylogenetic analyses for sect. Viridicata, the most speciose section in the subgenus, were divided into three sets of species, and the results are shown in Figs. 2-4. Penicillium gladioli (sect. Penicillium, ser. Gladioli) was used as outgroup for these analyses based on its position in Fig. 1. The species formed a monophyletic group, and was apparently related to sect. Viridicata based on consensus but not bootstrap support. formed a Section Viridicata ser. Viridicata monophyletic group in Fig.1 (86% bootstrap support), and was divided into three subclades supported by strict consensus in Fig. 2, which shows one of eight MPTs. The largest clade included P. tricolor, P. freii, P. neoechinulatum, P. viridicatum and P. aurantio- griseum. Penicillium melanoconidium formed its own clade, and the sister group relationship with the P. polonicum/P. cyclopium clade suggested in Fig. 2 has no bootstrap or consensus support.

...INTRODUCTION

The Penicillium chrysogenum series was proposed by Raper and Thorn (1949) to include four species: Peniciltium chrysogenum Thorn, P. meleagrinum Biourge, P. notatum Westling and P. cyaneoJulvum Biourge. Raper and Thorn (1949) stated, however, that while it is extremely difficult to define a species in this series it is obvious that all strains belonging to it cannot be regarded as representing a single species, for many of them differ greatly from one another in almost any character selected as a basis of comparison. Moreover, Thorn (1930) had already made the following statement about the type strain of P. chrysogenum : "Re-examination of records of observations over the twenty- two years this species has been kept in culture shows as great a range in color in the various recorded experiments as is shown by the whole series of the Radiata" (= P. chrysogenum-series)....
