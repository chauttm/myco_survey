In addition, they transferred all symmetrically branched biverticillate Penicillium species to Talaromyces. More than 80 species are described in Talaromyces and approximately 30 species have a sexual state. Sexually reproducing Talaromyces species are charac- terized by the production of yellow or white cleistothecia. Talaromyces macrosporus and Talaromyces trachyspermus are regularly found in pasteurized products. The former species is known in older literature under the name Talaromyces flavus: however, the correct name for this heat-resistant species is T. macrosporus. Talaromyces trachyspermus can be differentiated from T. macrosporus by the formation of cream or straw-colored ascomata. Talaromyces macrosporus forms distinct yellow ascomata. Talaromyces...

Based on multigene phy- logeny, morphology and extrolites, 88 species were accepted and divided into seven sections: Bacillispori, Helici, Islandici, Purpurei, Subinﬂati, Talaromyces and Trachyspermi. Visagie (2015) added ﬁve new species with ampulliform-like et al. phialides to section Talaromyces. Later, Yilmaz et al. (2016b) resolved the taxonomy within section Islandici using a poly- phasic approach and introduced four new species, T. acaricola, T. crassus, T. infraolivaceus and T. subaurantiacus. In the same year, eight new species, T. amazonensis, T. columbiensis, T. francoae, T. neofusisporus, T. purgamentorum, T. qii, T. rubrifaciens and T. systylus, were described from Argentina,...

Our phylogenetic studies demonstrate that several taxa represent complexes of morphologically cryptic phylogenetic species, requiring further study. For example, we analysed members of the Penicillium purpurogenum complex (including P. purpurogenum, P. rubrum, P. crateriforme, P. sanguineum) and found that several species group could be distinguished by sequencing certain genes (N. Yilmaz, unpubl. data) and had distinct macromorphological features and unique extrolite profiles. The full phylogenetic diversity of the P. purpurogenum species complex requires more investigation, and a more detailed account will be published elsewhere.
