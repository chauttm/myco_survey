### Answer 15

Penicillium roqueforti Thom forms colonies that are spreading and have a velvety texture. The conidiophores (structures from which spores are produced) are terverticillate, meaning they arise in groups or clusters at the ends of branches, with tuberculate stipes (the part of the conidiophore to which the conidia attach). The conidia (spores) are globose to subglobose and smooth-walled. This species can grow well at low pH conditions such as media containing 0.5% acetic acid, in high alcohol concentrations, and with elevated CO2 levels.

Growth is good but no acid production occurs on Creatine agar medium (CREA). The sexual morph of P. roqueforti has not been observed under culture conditions. In terms of nomenclature, it belongs to the section Roquefortorum within subgenus Penicillium based on phylogenetic relationships and morphology.

This description is derived from the taxonomy studies described in various papers related to the taxonomic classification and identification methods for species within the genus Penicillium.

Type: Penicillium roqueforti Thom

Frisvad & Samson (2004) erected section Roqueforti for rapidly growing species forming strictly velutinous colonies. All species form terverticillate rough walled conidiophores and are able to grow at low pH values (e.g. on media containing 0.5 % acetic acid), at high alcohol concentrations and at elevated CO2 levels. Members of this section appear to have a symbiotic relationship with lactic acid bacteria and certain acid-tolerant yeasts. Currently, four species are described in this section (Frisvad & Samson 2004, Houbraken et al. 2010a):...

...al., 2000). Members of ser. Roqueforti had species specific ITS sequences (with 13 variable sites within the complex) (Boysen et al., 1996). The exploration of ribosomal DNA sequences was continued by Peterson (2000), who combined ITS and partial large subunit (D1 and D2 domains) sequences. This demonstrated the infrageneric phylogenetic structure of the entire genus, allowing phylogenetic evaluation of the infrageneric taxonomy proposed by Pitt (1979). Subgenus Penicillium, the focus of the present study, was identified as a monophyletic group by Skouboe et al. (1996) and Peterson (2000). There is evidence that certain species traditionally classified in Penicillium subgenus Furcatum, including P. lanosum (as P. kojigenum), P. raistrickii, P. soppii, P. swiecickii and P. matriti and some Eupenicillia such as E. crustaceum, E. egyptiacum, E. baarnense could also be included as part of a large well-supported clade (Peterson 2000, Peterson et al., 2003) within subgenus Penicillium.
