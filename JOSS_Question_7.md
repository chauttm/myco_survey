### Answer 2

I found no answer based on the paper collection. The provided papers do not provide a list of accepted Aspergillus species starting with 'a'. However, I can suggest some possible sources where you may be able to find this information:

1. MycoBank: A comprehensive online database of fungal names that includes information on accepted species.
2. Fungal Classification System (FCS): A widely used classification system for fungi that provides information on accepted species.
3. International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICNf): An international code that governs the naming of fungi, including Aspergillus.

You can try searching these sources to find a list of accepted Aspergillus species starting with 'a'.

### Answer 11

I found no answer based on the paper collection. The provided snippets do not contain an exhaustive list of all accepted Aspergillus species or any information that could be used to identify those starting with 'a'. They provide lists of some sections and series within the genus Aspergillus, along with descriptions of some species, but they don't give a comprehensive breakdown by initial letter.

### Answer 12

I found no answer based on the paper collection.

---

### Answer 13

Based on the information provided in the research snippets:

- The snippet about "Accepted species" does not start with an 'A', so there are no accepted Aspergillus species that start with 'a'. 

I found no answer based on the paper collection.

...Proposed list of accepted Aspergillus names

The following list includes species accepted in the genus Aspergillus and is updated from Pitt & Samson (1993) and Pitt et al. (2000). Noticeable changes from the previous lists are the incorporation of Aspergillus names for species previously accepted in the associated teleomorphic genera, as well as species previously classiﬁed in Cristaspora, Dichotomomyces, Basipetospora, Phialosimplex and Polypaecilum as well as Penicillium inﬂatum. The nomenclatural list includes MycoBank numbers, collection numbers of type and ex-type cultures and GenBank accession numbers to ITS barcodes and alternative identiﬁcation markers BenA, CaM and RPB2. Similar lists are published for Penicillium (Visagie et al. 2014a) and Talaromyces (Yilmaz et al. 2014)....

Below an overview of accepted species in Aspergillus section Flavi (in bold font) and their synonyms. Aspergillus oryzae and A. sojae are domesticated forms of A. ﬂavus and A. parasiticus, respectively. Partial calmodulin gene sequencing, the recom- mended method for identiﬁcation of Aspergilli, can’t differentiate these domesticated forms from their wild types. Differentiation between A. oryzae/A. sojae and A. ﬂavus/A. parasiticus is ﬁrst of all based on the inability of the domesticated forms to produce aﬂatoxins. The second character for identiﬁcation is the origin of the strain. Aspergillus oryzae and A. sojae strains are isolated from fermented (food) products or are used in biotechnology. Strains obtained from other environments, even if they are non-

Using a phylogenetic approach, often supported by phenotypic, physiologic and/or extrolite data, Aspergillus is subdivided in six subgenera, 27 sections (ﬁve new) and 75 series (73 new, one new com- bination), and Penicillium in two subgenera, 32 sections (seven new) and 89 series (57 new, six new combinations). Correct identiﬁcation of species belonging to the Eurotiales is difﬁcult, but crucial, as the species name is the linking pin to information.

INTRODUCTION

Aspergillus is one of the most studied fungal genera and has a great impact in many applied areas. The nomenclature of the species has always been an important issue because applied researchers do not like to see changes in species names, in particular for those which are common. Like all other fungi the naming of Aspergillus species must follow the Rules of the International Botanical Code. In the past however taxonomists have neglected these rules and for example Raper & Fennell (1965) only used Aspergillus names for sexual taxa and refused to use the correct names for the teleomorph....

...decided to keep Aspergillus instead of using smaller genera. In this paper, we present the arguments for this decision. We introduce new combinations for accepted species presently lacking an Aspergillus name and provide an updated accepted species list for the genus, now containing 339 species. To add to the scientiﬁc value of the list, we include information about living ex-type culture collection numbers and GenBank accession numbers for available representative ITS, calmodulin, β-tubulin and RPB2 se- quences. In addition, we recommend a standard working technique for Aspergillus and propose calmodulin as a secondary identiﬁcation marker....


**[8] K. Glässnerová, F. Sklenář, Ž. Jurjevi? et al.**. ***A monograph of Aspergillus section Candidi***. **2022**

...Aspergillus is a large genus of filamentous fungi which is divided into 27 sections. Aspergillus section Candidi currently includes seven white- or yellow-sporulating species (Houbraken et al. 2020). Members of this section show a relatively uniform morphology and their identification to a species level is non-trivial when using only phenotypic characters. The first modern monograph of the section was published by Varga et al. (2007) who used a polyphasic approach for species delimitation (combination of morphology, physiology, exometabolite profiles and molecular data) and recognized A. candidus [MB 204868] and three other species: A. tritici [MB 309248] (Mehrotra & Basu 1976), A. campestris [MB 110495] (Christensen 1982) and A. taichungensis [MB 434473] (Yaguchi et al. 1995). Since then, another three species have been described, namely, A. subalbidus [MB 809190] (Visagie et al. 2014), A. pragensis [MB 800371] (Hubka et al. 2014) and A. dobrogensis [MB 821313] (Hubka et al. 2018b)....
