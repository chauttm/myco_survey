---

### Answer 2

In Pitt JI's 1979 paper "The genus Penicillium and its teleomorphic states Eupenicillium and Talaromyces", Pitt introduced eight series for the classification of Eupenicillium, as part of his work on the taxonomy of the genus Penicillium.

---

### Answer 3

In Pitt JI (1979), The genus Penicillium and its teleomorphic states Eupenicillium and Talaromyces, Pitt proposed a classification system that included eight series for the genus Eupenicillium. This classification was based on a combination of various characters, such as growth rates in standard conditions, colony morphology, and microscopical characters of both teleomorphic and anamorphic states.

---

### Answer 4

In Pitt's 1979 paper "The Genus Penicillium and its Teleomorphic States Eupenicillium and Talaromyces", eight series were introduced as the first attempt to classify the genus Eupenicillium.

---

### Answer 5

According to Pitt JI (1979), the first attempt at a subgeneric classification of Eupenicillium, which is a teleomorphic state of some Penicillium species, introduced eight series. This classification was based on a combination of various characters, such as growth rates in standard conditions, colony morphology, and microscopical characters of both teleomorphic and anamorphic states.

### Answer 6

In Pitt (1979), a comprehensive study of the genus *Penicillium*,  Pitt introduced a **classification based on eight series** for *Eupenicillium*.  This classification system focused on various morphological and physiological characteristics to group these species.

### Answer 7

In Pitt JI (1979), he proposed an infrageneric classification based on **eight series** of species within the genus *Penicillium*. This system aimed to categorize different characteristics and traits of the species.

---

### Answer 8

In Pitt JI's 1979 work "The genus Penicillium and its teleomorphic states Eupenicillium and Talaromyces," he introduced a system of **eight series** to classify species within the *Eupenicillium* group.  This work was a significant step in establishing a more detailed classification for the genus.

---

### Answer 9

In Pitt (1979), a comprehensive work on the genus *Penicillium* and its teleomorphic states *Eupenicillium* and *Talaromyces*, the author introduced an eight-series classification for *Eupenicillium*. This was a significant step in establishing a more structured and consistent system for classifying these fungi.

---

### Answer 10

In Pitt (1979), a classification of *Penicillium* was proposed based on a combination of various characters, including:

* **Growth rates under standard conditions:** This helped to differentiate species based on their growth speed and behavior. 
* **Colony morphology:** The physical appearance of the colonies on agar plates served as another key differentiator.  
* **Microscopical characters of both teleomorphic and anamorphic states:**  This included examination of the structure of cells and spores under a microscope, providing further insights into species differences.

Pitt's approach involved eight series to categorize different *Penicillium* species based on these criteria.

### Answer 11

Pitt (1979) did not propose a specific classification for the genus Penicillium. The paper titled "The genus Penicillium and its teleomorphic states Eupenicillium and Talaromyces" by Pitt provides information on the genus, including species in both teleomorphic states (Penicillium and Eupenicillium) and their anamorphic state (Talaromyces), but it does not introduce a classification for Penicillium itself. The classification was proposed later in more recent works such as Pitt (1980).

---

### Answer 12

Pitt (1980) introduced eight series for the subgeneric classification of Eupenicillium, while his work from 1979 did not propose such a specific classification. Therefore, I found no answer based on the paper collection provided regarding Penicillium classification in Pitt (1979).

---

### Answer 13

Pitt (1980) introduced eight series for the subgeneric classification of Eupenicillium, while the first attempt to make a subgeneric classification of Eupenicillium was undertaken by Pitt (1980). Earlier work by Pitt in 1979 did not introduce such a classification.

---

### Answer 14

Based on the available snippets from the research papers, there is no specific classification proposal for Penicillium mentioned in Pitt's 1979 paper "The genus Penicillium and its teleomorphic states Eupenicillium and Talaromyces". The 1979 paper focuses more on introducing Eupenicillium and discussing the taxonomy of the related genera. Therefore, based solely on the information provided:

I found no answer based on the paper collection.

---

### Answer 15

Based on the information provided from the papers available, there is no specific classification proposal about Penicillium made by Pitt in his 1979 paper. The 1979 paper "The genus Penicillium and its teleomorphic states Eupenicillium and Talaromyces" primarily focuses on describing and differentiating between the genera Penicillium, Eupenicillium, and Talaromyces.

For a more detailed classification proposal related to Penicillium, you might want to look at Pitt's 1980 paper where he introduced eight series for classifying species. This was further modified in Stolk & Samson (1983) with four sections being introduced instead of the eight series proposed by Pitt in 1980.

---

### Answer 16

In 1979, J.I. Pitt proposed a classification system for Penicillium species based on morphological characteristics such as growth rates, colony morphology, and microscopical features. He introduced eight series to group the organisms within his teleomorphic states Eupenicillium and Talaromyces, laying the groundwork for a more comprehensive taxonomy approach that would later be expanded upon in subsequent works.

---

### Answer 17

Pitt JI proposed a classification of the genus Eupenicillium into eight series during his 1979 monograph titled "The Genus Penicillium and its teleomorphic states Eupenicillium and Talaromyces." He based this classification on various morphological characteristics, including growth rates in standard conditions, colony morphology, and microscopical features of both the teleomorphic and anamorphic states.

---

### Answer 18

Pitt JI proposed a classification of the Penicillium genus into eight series in his 1979 work "The Genus Penicillium and its teleomorphic states Eupenicillium and Talaromyces." This classification was based on morphological, physiological, and anamorphic characteristics. The introduction of these series marked the first attempt to systematically classify Eupenicillium within the broader genus.

**Answer:**  
Pitt (1979) proposed a classification of Eupenicillium into eight series, introducing the concept of teleomorphic states based on growth rates, colony morphology, and microscopical characters.

---

### Answer 19

In 1979, J.I. Pitt proposed a classification system for the genus Penicillium, dividing it into teleomorphic states: Eupenicillium and Talaromyces. This was introduced in his paper titled "The Genus Penicillium and its teleomorphic states Eupenicillium and Talaromyces."

---

### Answer 20

In 1980, J.I. Pitt proposed an eight-series classification for the genus Eupenicillium. This classification was based on morphological and physiological characteristics such as growth rates, colony morphology, and microscopical features of both teleomorphic states.

Answer:  
J.I. Pitt proposed in his 1980 paper an eight-series classification for Eupenicillium, which he developed after outlining the teleomorphic states in his earlier work from 1979.

...published work covering all Penicillium species, and forms the basis for many studies on Penicillium nowadays. The introduction of a standard inoculation and incubation regime and the typification of various Penicillium species by Pitt (1980) are important steps in the taxonomy of Penicillium. The International Commission of Penicillium and Aspergillus organized three workshops which had a great impact on the taxonomy of Trichocomaceae (Samson & Pitt 1985, 1989, 2000). Data on new approaches and lists of accepted species and types were published in these volumes. After Pitt’s monograph (1980), various new approaches, such as isoenzyme patterns, ubiquinone systems, extrolite profiles and DNA-based techniques (sequencing, RAPD, AFLP) were used to clarify the taxonomy of Penicillium. In the last decade, combinations of these techniques were applied for species delimitation (polyphasic taxonomy)....
