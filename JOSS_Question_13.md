...Penicillium Penicillium species are commonly occurring and, similar to Aspergillus, have diverse proper ties. Several species are known as food spoilage agents; however, the majority of species are soil-borne. Some species are also applied in biotechnology, e.g. Penicillium rubens is used in the production of the antibiotic penicillin, P. roqueforti and P. camemberti in cheese fermentations and P. brevicompactum in the production of the immunosuppressant drug mycophenolic acid. The genus name Penicillium was introduced by Link (1809) and is derived from 'penicillus~ which is Latin for little brush. A 'penicillus' consists of a well-defined cluster of phialides that are either attached to a stipe directly, or through one or more stages of branching (Pitt and Hocking, 2009). Penicillium is phylogenetically closely related to Aspergillus, but can easily be phenotypically differentiated. For example, the phialides are born successively and not simultaneously as in Aspergillus....

On a positive side, some species are used in food fermentation processes, in biotechnology for the production of enzymes, organic acids, and for the manufacturing of drugs. Examples include Penicillium roqueforti and Penicillium camemberti, which are used in the production of Roquefort and Camembert cheese respectively, Aspergillus oryzae, which is used to produce soy sauce, and Penicillium rubens, which is used to produce penicillin (Houbraken et al., 2011 b; Samson eta/., 2010). As these species can have both positive and negative impacts, their correct identification to species level is an important process in a number of fields, including food and medical mycology and biotechnology. Ideally, identification should be simple, accurate, unequivo cal and immutable. Until recently, fungal identification was primarily based on...

It can be found on cereals, coffee beans, dried salami and other meat products, tomatoes, pota- toes and mushrooms. It often spoils refrigerated pro- ducts, such as meat, cheese and margarine. It also occurs in soil, and is common in indoor air and water-damaged building materials.

Physiology. Penicillium brevicompactum is psychro- and halotolerant. It grows well at low temperatures, but cannot grow at 30 °C. It can tolerate low pH values and rather low water activities.

Biotechnological applications. Pro- duction of mycophenolic acid.

Biodeterioration and pathology. –
