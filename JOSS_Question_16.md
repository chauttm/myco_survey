## Generated Answers (20 responses)

### Answer 1

The reverse color of Penicillium discolor on CYA agar at 25°C is cream dull yellow to brown yellow, often with a brown centre. On MEA, it has a pale to sun yellow reverse. On YES, the colonies have a bright yellow to bright orange reverse.

---

### Answer 2

The reverse colors of Penicillium discolor on CYA, MEA, and DG18 are:

- Cream dull yellow to brown yellow
- Pale to sun yellow
- Bright yellow to bright orange 

On YES agar, P. discolor has a bright yellow to bright orange reverse color.

---

### Answer 3

The paper collection doesn't specify a particular reverse color for Penicillium discolor on all media. However, it does mention the reverse colors on CYA and YES as yellow-orange with an orange-red centre in Penicillium discolor, but other papers were not collected to confirm. 

On MEA, the colonies of P. discolor have a pale to sun yellow reverse.

Colonies growing rather restrictedly on CYA at 25 °C (diameter 21–36 mm after 7 days), producing dark green to dark bluish green conidia and velutinous to slightly granular colonies, with clear exudate droplets. The colony reverse is coloured cream dull yellow to brown yellow often with a brown centre.

### Answer 4

The reverse color of Penicillium discolor on CYA, MEA, and DG18 agar is described as:

- On CYA, it's colored cream dull yellow to brown yellow often with a brown centre.
- On MEA, the fasciculate colonies have a pale to sun yellow reverse.
- On YES, the colonies have a bright yellow to bright orange reverse.

Additionally, on CREA, strong growth with acid and subsequent base production is observed.

### Answer 11

The reverse colors on CYA and YES for Penicillium discolor are described as red brown or orange brown. On MEA, the colonies have a vivid yellow or pale yellow reverse.

---

### Answer 12

Based on the information provided in the research papers, the colony reverse colors for Penicillium discolor include red brown or orange brown. The papers describe that colonies of Penicillium discolor have a reverse colour often varying from shades of brown (red-brown, caramel or yellow-brown). However, it's important to note that this is specific information provided by the authors and might not encompass all variations found for this species in different environments or conditions.

---

### Answer 13

According to the information provided in various snippets, the reverse colors on different media for Penicillium discolor can vary. Here are some details:

- On CYA agar at 25°C, the colony reverse is coloured cream dull yellow to brown yellow often with a brown center.
- On MEA, the colonies have a pale to sun yellow reverse when growing moderately fast (diameter 28–51 mm after 7 days).
- On YES agar, the colonies have a bright yellow to bright orange reverse when growing moderately fast (diameter 28–51 mm after 7 days).

The exact color on CYA is not specified in terms of shades but generally describes it as cream dull yellow to brown yellow with often a brown center. For other media like MEA and YES, the reverses are described more specifically as bright yellow or orange.

Given these descriptions, there isn't a single specific reverse color mentioned for Penicillium discolor across all substrates. The variations suggest that the reverse colors may depend on the medium used.

---

### Answer 14

Penicillium discolor has a colony reverse that can be red-brown, orange-brown, or sometimes with a brown center. The paper mentions that the colony reverse for Penicillium discolor on CYA and YES agar is often coloured cream dull yellow to brown yellow, often with a brown center, though it can vary. Specifically, it notes colonies on MEA have a bright yellow to bright orange reverse.

---

### Answer 15

Penicillium discolor has a colony reverse that is coloured red brown or orange brown. The description states that the reverse is "coloured cream dull yellow to brown yellow often with a brown centre" for colonies growing rather restrictedly on CYA, but it also mentions that under certain conditions (such as prolonged growth on agar), the colony reverse can be "often with a brown center", indicating the potential for a more pronounced brown coloration. However, specific consistent colors like red brown or orange brown are noted in your query's context.

### Answer 16

The reverse color of Penicillium discolor when grown on CYA at 25°C is described as cream dull yellow to brown yellow, often with a central brown coloration. 

Answer: The reverse color of Penicillium discolor is cream dull yellow to brown yellow, with a central brown spot.

---

### Answer 17

Penicillium discolor colonies grown on nutrient agar (CYA) at 25°C exhibit reverse colors ranging from cream dull yellow to brown yellow. These shades often feature a noticeable brown center.

**Answer:** Penicillium discolor has colonies with reverse colors varying from cream dull yellow to brown yellow, sometimes featuring a brown center when grown on CYA.

---

### Answer 18

Penicillium discolor has a reverse color characterized by a mix of cream and yellow tones when observed on corn yield agar (CYA) at 25°C after seven days of growth, often with a brown center.

---

### Answer 19

Penicillium discolor has a reverse color characterized by a range of hues. On CYA (Cytosine Yellow Agar), the colonies display a creamy to brownish tone, which can vary from pale cream to deeper brown yellow. This shade is often accompanied by a central tendency towards brown in some instances. 

Answer: The reverse color of Penicillium discolor on CYA agar is typically cream dull yellow to brown yellow with a brown center.

---

### Answer 20

Penicillium discolor exhibits different reverse colors depending on the medium used:

- **On CYA (Cytosol Yellow Agar):** Reverse colors range from cream dull yellow with a brown center to darker brown shades.

- **On MEA (Modified Eagle Agar):** The colonies are green but show reverse colors that can be pale or sun-yellow, depending on the growth progress.

- **On YES Agar:** The reverse color is bright yellow to orange as the colonies grow and produce exudates. 

These variations in reverse color help distinguish Penicillium discolor from other species when observed under different conditions.

...Penicillium kananaskense (CBS 530.93T) was described as a pink-spored Penicillium species (Seifert et al. 1994). An additional strain of this species was examined (DTO 193-A3), which produced dark blue-green conidia on MEA. Although CBS 530.93T and DTO 193-A3 differ in conidial colour, they share some characters that are not observed in other species of the P. lividum-clade. For example, both strains grow slowly on CYA30°C (5–10 mm) and have a vivid yellow or orange reverse on CYA and YES with yellow pigments diffusing into the agar. Penicillium odoratum grows well on CYA30°C (28–35 mm) while P. lividum grows slowly (12–17 mm). The reverse colours on CYA and YES between these two species are similar (pale, beige, pale brown). The colony texture could also be used to distinguish these three species. Penicillium kananaskense produces velvety colonies on MEA, P. odoratum ﬂoccose colonies and the colonies of P. lividum have a lanose texture....


**[5] Jos Houbraken**. ***Revealing relationships in Trichocomaceae, with emphasis on Penicillium***. **2013**

...Diagnostic characters: Yellow soluble pigments (sorbicillins), metulae of unequal length, with inflated apex.

Similar species: Penicillium anatolicum is phylogenetically related to P. euglaucum and P. argentinense. The ascospores of P. euglaucum are larger than those of P. anatolicum and P. argentinense. In addition, P. argentinense does not produce yellow soluble pigments. Penicillium gallaicum also produces yellow soluble pigments (citreoviridins), but forms predominantly monoverticillate conidiophores and produces sclerotia instead of ascomata.

Distribution and ecology: Soil seems to be the primary habitat; isolated in Turkey, Florida, USA and South-Africa.

...Physiology. Penicillium discolor is halo- and psychro- tolerant. It grows well at low temperatures, and does not grow (or only poorly) at 30 °C. It can tolerate low pH values and rather low water activities.

Morphs. Asexual morph present, basipetal phialidic conidiogenesis; sexual morph not known.

Similar species. Penicillium echinulatum grows faster and has a less vividly coloured reverse on YES agar.
