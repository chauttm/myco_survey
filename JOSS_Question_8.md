...Approximately 108 taxa (species, subspecies and varieties) have been described in Aspergillus section Nigri (Mosseray 1934, Raper & Fennell 1965, Samson 1979, 1992, Al-Musallam 1980, Kozakiewicz 1989). Of these, we provisionally accept 15 taxonomic enti- ties, including the four new species described here. The reason for the multiplicity of proposed names may be that isolates of section Nigri are readily iso- lated world-wide but are difficult to distinguish. Often very small differences in texture or conidial colour have been used as the basis for distinguishing new taxa. Phenotypic comparisons of a broad collec- tion of black aspergilli showed that 15 taxa can be distinguished. Most of these species could be distin- guished by combinations of colony and micromor- phological characters and extrolite profiles, including the new species described below in addition to A. ellipticus, A. carbonarius, A. japonicus, A. vadensis, and A. heteromorphus.
