### Answer 11

Based on the provided information, Penicillium nalgiovense produces white or pale green conidia when growing on CYA at 25°C, and they are described as being mostly flat velvety or slightly floccose colonies with a pale or yellow reverse. However, the specific color of conidia for P. nalgiovense is not directly stated in the provided snippets. The snippet mentions that conidia can be white or pale green when growing on CYA at 25°C and have a pale to sun yellow reverse.

---

### Answer 12

According to the information provided in the research papers about Penicillium nalgiovense, it has white or pale green conidia on MEA and blue green conidia on MEA. The colonies produced by P. nalgiovense are characterized as growing relatively slow at 25°C (producing a diameter of 15-35 mm after 7 days), producing white or pale green conidia, and typically having strong yellow to orange brown reverse colors.

---

### Answer 13

According to the information provided in the research paper snippets, colonies of Penicillium nalgiovense produce white or pale green conidia. The snippet describes that on CYA at 25°C, the colonies grow relatively slowly (diameter 15-35 mm after 7 days), producing white or pale green conidia, mostly consisting of a dense felt of conidiophores giving velvety colonies.

---

### Answer 14

According to the information provided in the research paper snippets, Penicillium nalgiovense has white or pale green conidia when grown on MEA (Medler agar). On MEA, the colonies are growing rapidly with a bright yellow to yellowish orange reverse. However, for growth on CYA at 25°C, the conidia are described as "white or pale green" and they produce a dense felt of conidiophores that results in velvety colonies. The colony reverse is described as strong yellow, orange brown, but sometimes just beige or pale cream.

---

### Answer 15

According to the information provided in the research paper snippets about Penicillium nalgiovense, it produces white or pale green conidia. The snippet mentions that on MEA (Malt Extract Agar), the colonies are mostly growing faster and the conidia are white or pale green with flat velvety or slightly floccose colonies having a pale or yellow reverse.

---

### Answer 16

The conidiums of Penicillium nalgiovense Laxa are typically white or pale green.

---

### Answer 17

Penicillium nalgiovense (Laxa) has white or pale green conidia on CYA at 25°C, producing colonies that are velvety or slightly floccose with a fine walled texture. The colony reverse color is often strong yellow, orange brown, but can also appear just beige or pale cream.

---

### Answer 18

Penicillium nalgiovense has pale green conidia, especially when grown on media like MEA, where the colonies develop into flat velvety or slightly floccose structures.

---

### Answer 19

Penicillium nalgiovense produces conidia in colors that vary depending on the medium and growth conditions. On CYA at 25°C, it forms dark green or pale yellow conidia with a reversal towards orange brown. On MEA, it grows faster with white or pale green conidia and velvety or slightly floccose colonies having a reverse color of pale or yellow.

Answer: Penicillium nalgiovense produces conidia in colors that can be dark green to pale yellow depending on the medium.

### Answer 20

Penicillium nalgiovense exhibits several morphological characteristics based on the provided information:

1. **Conidiophores and Conidia**: 
   - The species produces dark green conidia in natural isolates but tends to produce white or pale green conidia under industrial conditions.

2. **Molecular Markers**:
   - β-tubulin marker: AY 495999-496000 is associated with this species, indicating its place within the genus.

3. **Macromorphology on Various Agars**:
   - On CYA at 25°C, colonies grow to a diameter of 15–35 mm after 7 days, with light yellow mycelium and pale green conidia.
   - The colony reverse varies in color: strong yellow or orange brown, which can sometimes appear as beige or pale cream.

In summary, Penicillium nalgiovense is known for its dark green natural conidia but typically exhibits white or pale green conidia under certain conditions. On CYA at 25°C, it features light yellow mycelium and reverse colors that can range from strong yellows to light beiges.

...Penicillium kananaskense (CBS 530.93T) was described as a pink-spored Penicillium species (Seifert et al. 1994). An additional strain of this species was examined (DTO 193-A3), which produced dark blue-green conidia on MEA. Although CBS 530.93T and DTO 193-A3 differ in conidial colour, they share some characters that are not observed in other species of the P. lividum-clade. For example, both strains grow slowly on CYA30°C (5–10 mm) and have a vivid yellow or orange reverse on CYA and YES with yellow pigments diffusing into the agar. Penicillium odoratum grows well on CYA30°C (28–35 mm) while P. lividum grows slowly (12–17 mm). The reverse colours on CYA and YES between these two species are similar (pale, beige, pale brown). The colony texture could also be used to distinguish these three species. Penicillium kananaskense produces velvety colonies on MEA, P. odoratum ﬂoccose colonies and the colonies of P. lividum have a lanose texture....

...Diagnostic characters: Light yellow mycelium (especially on CYA15°C and/or YES), blue green conidia on MEA and finely roughened, thick walled conidia.

Similar species: Penicillium vancouverense is phylogentically related to P. pasqualense, but the latter species does not have yellow mycelium and has a dark-brown reverse on CYA. Penicillium manginii and some strains of P. miczynskii and related species also form yellow mycelium; P. manginii can be differentiated by the faster growth rate on CYA and the red soluble on YES; P. miczynskii and related species have smooth walled, subglobose to broadly ellipsoidal conidia.

Distribution and ecology: Penicillium vancouverense has a worldwide distribution (the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Chile, California, USA, Queensland, Australia, Madagascar, BC and Ontario, Canada). Soil appears to be the primary habitat, but this species is also isolated from indoor air of a house and a nut of Juglans cinerea (butternut)....

Penicillium nalgiovense Laxa

Teleomorph not known.

Molecular markers. β-tubulin: AY 495999-496000.

Macromorphology. Colonies growing relatively slow on CYA at 25 °C (diameter 15-35 mm after 7 days), producing white or pale green conidia, mostly consisting of a dense felt of conidiophores giving velvety colonies. Industrial strains may be somewhat floccose, however. Isolates from nature often have dark green conidia. Exudate typically produced as yellow drops, sometime hyaline or absent. The colony reverse is coloured strong yellow, orange brown, but sometimes just beige or pale cream. On MEA colonies are mostly growing faster, the conidia are white or pale green and flat velvety or slightly floccose colonies having a pale or yellow reverse. On YES agar the degree of sporulation is strong, reverse colour distinct orange yellow. The colonies are growing rapidly (diameter 28-45 mm after 7 days).

...According to Raper & Thorn's conception (1949), P. funiculosum is an extremely variable species, especially as regards the appearance ofthe colony. Broadly spreading as well as restrictedly growing strains belong to it. The colour of the colonies varies depending upon the amount and colour of the aerial mycelium which is usually yellow, the reverse may show such different colours as pink, red, yellowish or brownish. The older penicilli of the strains are often characterized by a greenish colour which may be lacking in young structures, but very striking in sclerotium-producing strains. The conidia of these strains are all very much alike.

red, but occasionally colourless. Moreover,

A more detailed examination of a larger number of strains of P. funiculosum is necessary to decide on the desirability of a subdivision into varieties, based on cultural appearance and rate of growth.

...Identification. Morphological characteristics of the co- nidiophores can be used for the classification, in addition to features of growth rate, obverse and reverse colour and colony texture. For more detailed descriptions and keys of ter- and quaterverticillate Penicillia, see Frisvad & Samson (2004). The species concept in Penicillium is currently based on a polyphasic approach, using a combination of the morphology of the conidiophores and conidia, colony characteristics on various media and temperatures, extrolite profiles and molecular data (mainly partial β-tubulin sequences) (Visagie et al. 2014a)....
