---

### Answer 2

According to the provided research papers, all members of the series Chrysogena and P. griseofulvum are efficient producers of the antibiotic penicillin. Additionally, several other species in the subgenus Penicillium, such as Penicillium rubens, can also produce penicillin.

---

### Answer 3

According to the paper, most members of the series Chrysogena and P. griseofulvum are able to produce the important antibiotic penicillin.

---

### Answer 4

Several species in the genus Penicillium are able to produce penicillin, but the most notable ones belong to series Chrysogena and P. griseofulvum.

These specific series contain strains that have been extensively studied for their ability to produce penicillin. Additionally, some other species like P. solitum and P. hirsutum are also known to produce compactin (a cholesterol-lowering agent), but I couldn't find any information on the production of penicillin by these species.

So, based on the research paper snippets provided, series Chrysogena and P. griseofulvum seem to be the primary sources for penicillin-producing Penicillium species.

### Answer 11

Based on the information provided in the research snippets, Penicillium rubens is used for the production of the antibiotic penicillin. However, this snippet does not provide a comprehensive list or confirmation that all Penicillium species are capable of producing penicillin. It specifically mentions P. rubens as an example rather than stating it universally applies to all species in the genus Penicillium. Therefore, I found no answer based on the paper collection regarding which specific species can produce penicillin beyond mentioning P. rubens.

---

### Answer 12

Based on the information provided in the papers, Penicillium rubens is used in the production of penicillin. Specifically, the relevant excerpt states:

"Some species are also applied in biotechnology, e.g. Penicillium rubens is used in the production of the antibiotic penicillin"

Therefore, Penicillium rubens can produce penicillin.

---

### Answer 13

Based on the information provided in the research snippets, Penicillium chrysogena and P. griseofulvum are known to produce the antibiotic penicillin.

---

### Answer 14

Based on the information provided in the research snippets, the Penicillium species known to produce penicillin are:

1. P. rubens is used in the production of the antibiotic penicillin.
2. There is a discussion about other species (like P. ochrochloron and P. pulvillorum) producing penicillic acid, which is also found in members of the series Chrysogena and P. griseofulvum.

However, the direct statement that Penicillium species can produce penicillin specifically as an antibiotic seems to be limited to mentioning P. rubens. There are no other specific mentions or confirmations of penicillin production by other Penicillium species in the given snippets.

---

### Answer 15

Based on the information provided in the research snippets, Penicillium chrysogena and P. griseofulvum are known to produce penicillin. Specifically:

- Penicillium chrysogena (series Chrysogena) is a species that produces penicillin.
- Penicillium griseofulvum also produces penicillin.

The snippets mention these two species as being relevant to the production of penicillin within the genus Penicillium. No other species mentioned produce this antibiotic according to the provided information.

---

### Answer 16

The Penicillium species capable of producing penicillin include:

1. All members of the series Chrysogena and the genus P. griseofulvum.

2. Penicillium bovifimosum, which also produces a fumagillin-like compound alongside penicillin.

---

### Answer 17

The Penicillium species that can produce penicillin are:

1. **Penicillium griseofulvum** - Members of this genus produce penicillin.
2. **Series Chrysogena** - All species within this series also produce penicillin.

Other species mentioned, such as P. spinul sums, P. bovifimosum, and others from various subgenres or sections, do not produce penicillin based on the provided information.

---

### Answer 18

Based on the analysis of the provided information:

1. **Penicillin Production in Penicillium Species**:
   - **Pend AH (Penicillium rubens)**: Known for producing penicillin, which is used industrially.
   - **Series Chrysogena and P. griseofulvum**: These genera within the Penicillium group produce penicillin.
   - **Pend AI (P. ochrochloron) and P. II (P. pulvillorum)**: Both produce penicillin, with specific species contributing to its production.

These findings indicate that multiple species and genera within the Penicillium genus are capable of producing penicillin through various metabolic pathways.

---

### Answer 19

Based on the provided research papers, **Penicillium species in the genus Chrysogena** and **Penicillium species in the genus P. griseofulvum** are able to produce penicillin.

Additionally, several Penicillium species within the subgenus *Turbata* (such as *P. matriti*, *P. bovifimosum*, and *P. turbatum*) also produce penicillin.

---

### Answer 20

The Penicillium species that can produce penicillin, based on the provided scientific papers, are:

1. All members of the series Chrysogena and P. griseofulvum.

It's important to note that while some species in other subgenuses (e.g., Furcatum) produce compounds like penicillic acid, these are derivatives or related metabolites of penicillin rather than the actual antibiotic drug itself.

...Penicillium Penicillium species are commonly occurring and, similar to Aspergillus, have diverse proper ties. Several species are known as food spoilage agents; however, the majority of species are soil-borne. Some species are also applied in biotechnology, e.g. Penicillium rubens is used in the production of the antibiotic penicillin, P. roqueforti and P. camemberti in cheese fermentations and P. brevicompactum in the production of the immunosuppressant drug mycophenolic acid. The genus name Penicillium was introduced by Link (1809) and is derived from 'penicillus~ which is Latin for little brush. A 'penicillus' consists of a well-defined cluster of phialides that are either attached to a stipe directly, or through one or more stages of branching (Pitt and Hocking, 2009). Penicillium is phylogenetically closely related to Aspergillus, but can easily be phenotypically differentiated. For example, the phialides are born successively and not simultaneously as in Aspergillus....

...Penicillium species belonging the subgenus Furcatum are efficient producers of metabolites and the extrolites patterns are effective markers for species recognition (Frisvad & Filtenborg 1989, Tuthill et al. 2001, Sonjak et al. 2007). We found that each new species produced unique and characteristic patterns of known and uncharacterized metabolites; an overview is given in Table 2. Penicillium vanderhammenii and P. penarojense were closely related and both produced paxillin, paspaline, shaerinin/janthitrem and a number of uncharacterized metabolites. This close relationship was also observed in the phylogenetic study. These species could be differentiated by the ability of P. vanderhammenii to produce penicillic acid. Penicillic acid is also produced by P. ochrochloron and P. pulvillorum (Frisvad & Filtenborg 1989). Pulvilloric acid was produced by P. wotroi and this metabolite is also produced by P. pulvillorum (syn. P. ciegleri) and P. piscarium (Tuthill et al. 2001). The extrolite...

...In conclusion, species in Penicillium subgenus Peni- cillium produce a very large number of biologically active extrolites, including some of the most important pharmaceuticals and mycotoxins. The biosynthetic potential in this subgenus and its 58 species is very large and still not fully explored. We predict that several new interesting bioactive extrolites will be found in Penicillium.

Extrolites: Penicillium spinulosum has been reported to produce spi- nulosin (Birkinshaw & Raistrick 1931, Anslow & Raistrick 1938, Pettersson 1965). The original producing strain, IMI 091950, did not match the description of P. spinulosum (results reported here). Peni- cillium subspinulosum produces frequentin and palitantin (Houbraken et al. 2014b), in common with P. trzebinskii; P. spinulosum produces asperfuran, while P. sterculiniicola produces asperfuran and 12,13- deoxybrevianamide E.
