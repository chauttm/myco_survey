...Section Talaromyces species are commonly isolated from soil, indoorenvironments,humanswithpenicilliosisandfoodproducts. Common species include T. ﬂavus, T. funiculosus, T. macro- sporus, T. marneffei, T. pinophilus and T. purpurogenus. Talar- omycespurpurogenusproducesrubratoxin,whichisawell-known hepa-carcinogenic toxin (Burnside et al. 1957, Kihara et al. 2001). Talaromyces marneffei is the only thermal dimorphic Talaromyces species and is a pathogen of especially HIV patients mostly diagnosed in East Asia (Deng et al. 1988, Supparatpinyo et al. 1994, Chiang et al. 1998, Hien et al. 2001). Talaromyces pino- philus and T. funiculosus are important enzymeproducers (Rao et al.1983,Wood&McCrae1986,Randoetal.1997,Sukhachevaet al. 2004). Talaromyces cellulolyticus was recently introduced for Acremonium cellulolyticus (strains Y-94), an important cellulose- degrading species (Fujii et al. 2013). However, based on their sequence data (ITS: AB474749 and BenA: AB773823) we do not consider...

Stolk & Samson (1972), who showed that the ascomatal coverings of T. bacillisporus are much better developed than those of R. emersonii and R. byssochlamydoides, already had doubts about the relationship between T. bacillisporus and R. emersonii. They suggest that T. bacillisporus resembles an intermediate form between the section Emersonii and section Talaromyces. Pitt (1979) placed the anamorph of T. bacillisporus in Geosmithia (as G. swiftii), suggesting a close relationship...

The	results	showed that strains belonging to T. amestolkiae, T. ruber and T. stollii form a phylogenetically distinct clade, separate from the distinctly related T. purpurogenus clade.

...Abstract: Talaromyces contains both asexual and sexually reproducing species. This genus is divided in seven sections and currently has 105 accepted species. In this study we investigated the Talaromyces isolates that were obtained during a study of indoor air collected in Beijing, China. These indoor Talaromyces strains are resolved in four sections, seven of them are identiﬁed as T. islandicus, T. aurantiacus, T. siamensis and T. albobiverticillius according to BenA sequences, while 14 isolates have divergent sequences and are described here as nine new species. The new species are placed in four sections, namely sections Helici, Islandici, Talaromyces and Trachyspermi. They are described based on sequence data (ITS, BenA, CaM and RPB2) in combination with phenotypic and extrolite characters. Morphological descriptions and notes for distinguishing similar species are provided for each new species. The recently described T. rubrifaciens is synonymised with T. albobiverticillius based...
