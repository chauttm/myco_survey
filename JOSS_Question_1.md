# Question 1

**Question:** Which species produce aflatoxin B?

## Generated Answers (20 responses)

### Answer 1

Based on the provided research papers, several Aspergillus species are known to produce aflatoxin B. These include:

1. A. flavus
2. A. parasiticus
3. A. nomius
4. A. pseudotamarii
5. A. bombycis

These species are classified under the Aspergillus section Flavi, and they have been reported to produce aflatoxin B as part of their secondary metabolite profiles.

It's worth noting that a specific type of aflatoxin, referred to as "B-type" aflatoxins, is typically produced by A. flavus. However, the other species listed above may also produce some level of aflatoxin B, although the exact extent and characteristics of this production can vary between species.

I found no information on species outside of the Aspergillus genus that are known to produce aflatoxin B.

### Answer 2

According to the provided research papers, the following Aspergillus species are known to produce aflatoxin B:

1. A. flavus (most common species producing aflatoxins)
2. A. parasiticus
3. A. pseudotamarii
4. A. bombycis
5. A. parvisclerotigenus
6. A. minisclerotigenes
7. A. arachidicola

It's worth noting that the paper also mentions that some other species, such as Emericella astellata and E. venezuelensis (from section Nidulantes), produce aflatoxin B2 instead of aflatoxin B1.

A. flavus var. columnaris is mentioned to produce aflatoxin B2, but only in the specific strains NRRL 5821 and IBT 12654.

It's also important to note that not all isolates of these species produce aflatoxins, and that some may be able to produce other types of mycotoxins.

### Answer 3

According to the provided research papers, several Aspergillus species are known to produce aflatoxin B:

1. A. flavus
2. A. pseudotamarii
3. A. parasiticus
4. A. nomius
5. A. bombycis
6. A. parvisclerotigenus
7. A. minisclerotigenes
8. A. arachidicola
9. A. flavus var. columnaris (although it only produces B2 as a minor extrolite)

It's worth noting that the majority of aflatoxin-producing species belong to section Flavi, which includes these nine species mentioned above.

Also, according to the World Mycotoxin Journal 2 (3) article, A. ochraceoroseus produces more aflatoxin B1 than E. venezuelensis and E. astellata, but less than members of section Flavi, whereas A. rambellii also produces aflatoxin B1.

However, some species claimed to produce aflatoxins have been later found not to be true producers or were synonymized with other aflatoxin-producing species.

### Answer 10

According to the provided research papers, the following species are known to produce aflatoxin B:

* **A. flavus:** This is considered the most common species producing aflatoxins.  It's important to note that some A. flavus isolates produce a variety of aflatoxins, while others produce predominantly B-type. 
* **A. pseudotamarii:** This species also produces a significant amount of aflatoxin B.
* **Other known aflatoxin producing species:**  The paper lists several other species belonging to sections Flavi, Nidulantes and Ochraceorosei that have been confirmed as producers of aflatoxins. These include A. nomius, A. zhaoqingensis, A. parvisclerotigenus, A. bombycis, and more.

It's crucial to understand that the presence of aflatoxin B does not necessarily mean other aflatoxins are produced, as different strains and isolates may produce a range of metabolites.

---

### Answer 11

Based on the information provided in the research snippets, several Aspergillus species are known to produce aflatoxin B:

1. A. flavus
2. A. pseudotamarii (Ito et al., 2001)
3. A. parasiticus (Codner et al. 1963, Schroeder 1966)
4. A. bombycis (Peterson et al., 2001)

Other species mentioned that can produce aflatoxin B1 but are not necessarily known to produce aflatoxin B include:

- Aspergillus ochraceoroseus 
- Aspergillus rambellii

The list of aflatoxin-producing species is quite extensive, including many other members of section Flavi and other sections in the genus Aspergillus. It's important to note that not all reported species produce aflatoxins or are correctly identified as producing them.

---

### Answer 12

Based on the information provided in the papers:

- Aflatoxins are produced by several species listed under Aspergillus section Flavi: A. flavus, A. pseudotamarii, and A. parasiticus.
- The closely related species A. tamarii is not able to produce aflatoxins, despite some reports suggesting it can.

No other specific species are mentioned as producing aflatoxin B in this collection of papers. Therefore, based on the data provided, aflatoxin B is produced by A. flavus, A. pseudotamarii (mentioned under "another effective producer of B type aflatoxins"), and possibly A. parasiticus, but not by A. tamarii or other species like A. zhaoqingensis.

...Aspergillus flavus is the most common species producing aflatoxins (Sargeant et al., 1961) and other economically important mycotoxins including e.g. cyclopiazonic acid (Dorner et al., 1983) and gliotoxin (Fox and Howlett, 2008), occurring in most kinds of foods in tropical countries. This species is very common on maize, peanuts and cottonseed, and produces only B-type aflatoxins. It has been estimated that only about 30-40% of known isolates produce aflatoxin. A. flavus populations are genetically and phenotypically diverse (Geiser et al., 2000) with some isolates producing conidia abundantly, produce large (L) sclerotia, and variable amounts of aflatoxins, while another type produces abundant, small (S) sclerotia, fewer conidia and high levels of aflatoxins (Cotty, 1989). Probst et al. (2007) found that the 2004 aflatoxicosis outbreak in Kenya was caused by S-type isolates of A. flavus which produced large amounts of aflatoxin B1.

The list of species that have been (incorrectly) reported to produce aflatoxins is very long; several species have been reported to be able to produce this metabolite (Tables 1 and 2). None of these species produce aflatoxins, and many of these names are not accepted as valid species in any case. The reports on aflatoxin-producing abilities of A. terreus could be due to the fact that territrems reveal blue fluorescence under long-wave ultraviolet (UV) light and have retention values similar to that of aflatoxin B1 on

...Aflatoxins are decaketide-derived secondary metabolites which are produced by a complex biosynthetic pathway. Aflatoxins are among the economically most important mycotoxins. Aflatoxin B1 exhibits hepatocarcinogenic and hepatotoxic properties, and is frequently referred to as the most potent naturally occurring carcinogen. Acute aflatoxicosis epidemics occur in several parts of Asia and Africa leading to the death of several hundred people. Aflatoxin production has incorrectly been claimed for a long list of Aspergillus species and also for species assigned to other fungal genera. Recent data indicate that aflatoxins are produced by 13 species assigned to three sections of the genus Aspergillus: section Flavi (A. flavus, A. pseudotamarii, A. parasiticus, A. nomius, A. bombycis, A. parvisclerotigenus, A. minisclerotigenes, A. arachidicola), section Nidulantes (Emericella astellata, E. venezuelensis, E. olivicola) and section Ochraceorosei (A. ochraceoroseus, A. rambellii).
