...The use of an infrageneric classiﬁcation system has a long tradition in Aspergillus and the genus is subdivided in subgenera, sections and series. Aspergillus ﬂavus belongs to subgenus Circumdati, section Flavi, series Flavi. Section Flavi includes 35 species and is subdi- vided in eight series (Alliacei, Avenacei, Bertholletiarum, Coremiiformes, Flavi, Kitamyces, Leporum and Nomiarum). The species belonging to this section generally grow fast on agar media, and produce yellow-green or brown colored conidia (except series Alliacei, yellow) on uni- and/or biseriate conidiophores.

...INTRODUCTION

Aspergillus is a large genus of ﬁlamentous fungi, which currently contains 446 accepted species and this number is rapidly rising. Aspergilli have traditionally been classiﬁed into subgenera and sections, and this classiﬁcation has been recently revised and updated with the addition of series rank (Houbraken et al. 2020). According to this most up-to-date overview, the accepted species are distributed over six sub- genera, 27 sections, and 75 series. Thom & Church (1926) introduced the A. ﬂavipes group and section Flavipedes was formally established by Gams et al. (1985). The section is close to sections Terrei and Jani (Kocsub(cid:1)e et al. 2016) and is sub- divided in four series: Flavipedes, Neonivei, Olivimuriarum and Spelaei (Houbraken et al. 2020). Phylogenetic analysis per- formed by Peterson (2008) demonstrated the presence of undescribed species diversity and the need for a proper taxo- nomic revision. The section was revised by Hubka et al.

Members of this section, such as A. flavus and A. parasiticus are important producers of aflatoxins in (sub)tropical food commodities, while their domesticated counterparts A. oryzae and A. sojae are used in oriental food fermentations and as hosts for heterologous gene expression. Although evidence suggests that A. sojae and A. oryzae are morphological variants of A. parasiticus and A. flavus, respectively, these species are separated because of the regulatory confusion that conspecificity might generate (Geiser, Pitt, & Taylor, 1998).

Several species have been described in the past which were assigned to Aspergillus section Flavi mainly based on traditional methods (morphological parameters, including colony diameter, colour and texture, size and texture of conidia and conidiophore structure; Klich 2002). However, species classification may be difficult due to extensive divergence of morphological characters produced by a high level of genetic variability (Kumeda & Asao 1996). Despite intense investigation, the taxonomy of this group of fungi is still highly complex. Recent data indicate that several of the species assigned to section Flavi cannot be distinguished based on morphological features alone (Frisvad et al. 2005, Pildain et al. 2008). Recently, a six-step molecular strategy using real-time PCR, RAPD and SmaI digestion of the nuclear DNA has been worked out to distinguish nine species of the section (Godet & Munaut 2010).

The genus Aspergillus represents a diverse group of fungi that are among the most abundant fungi in the world.

...The genus Aspergillus is classiﬁed in the family Aspergillaceae, order Eurotiales (Houbraken & Samson 2011). There is a long tradition of using an infrageneric classiﬁcation in Aspergillus; these are names of taxa between the ranks of genus and species (e.g., subgenera, sections, series). Using morphological char- acters, Raper & Fennell divided Aspergillus in 18 groups; how- ever, these groups do not have any standing nomenclature and should not be used anymore (Raper & Fennell 1965). To avoid confusion and to promote taxonomic stability, a formal infrage- neric classiﬁcation system was introduced by Gams et al. (1985) and they replaced the “group” structure by a subgeneric and sectional structure. Nowadays, the genus is subdivided in six subgenera, 27 sections and 87 series (Houbraken et al. 2020). infrageneric ranks are not commonly used in These formal medical mycology.
