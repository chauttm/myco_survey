### Answer 16

Penicillium polonicum is isolated primarily from cereals and dry meat products, as indicated by its occurrence in substrates such as cereals, onions, beans, and dried meat. This is supported by both the habitats section of a referenced paper, which specifies cereals and dry meat as suitable substrates for P. polonicum, and another study that highlights its association with cereals among other substrates. 

**Answer:** Penicillium polonicum can be isolated from cereals and dry meat products.

...Habitat and distribution. A majority of described Penicillium species are isolated from soil, but also quite a number of species is associated with food and indoor environments. Many species of Penicillium are common contaminants on various substrates, but some species are associated with certain products. For example, P. roqueforti is associated with preservative containing products and P. digitatum and P. italicum with citrus fruits. Furthermore, Penicillia are also known as potential mycotoxin producers (see Appendix II). Each species has its specific conditions for growth and production of extrolites (secondary metabolites). Correct identification is therefore important when studying Penicillium contamination....

...Included species: Penicillium kananaskense, P. lividum, P. odoratum.

Included species: Penicillium longicatenatum, P. vagum.

Extrolites: Penicillium longicatenatum produced kotanins, palitantin, spinulosin and a versicolorin, while the ex-type culture of P. vagum produces citrinin. Other strains supposed to be P. vagum were che- motaxonomically very different: DTO 038-E7 and DTO 056-I6 produced spinulosin and daldinins, while DTO 120-B1 and DTO 120-B4 produced asperfuran, dehydrocarolic acid, frequentin and palitantin. This indicates that P. vagum may be split into three species....

Important mycotoxins. Dehydropenicillic acid, neph- rotoxic glycopeptides, penicillic acid, verrucosidin.

Habitats and distribution. Food. Penicillium polonicum is common in temperate, subtropical and tropical regions. It occurs on cereals, where it causes blue mould, cereal-based feedstuffs, beans, peanuts, dried meat, onions and in soil.

Physiology. Penicillium polonicum is halotolerant. It grows well at low temperatures, grows rather well at 30 °C, and cannot grow at 37 °C. It can tolerate low pH values and rather low water activities.

Morphs. Asexual morph present, basipetal phialidic conidiogenesis; sexual morph not known.
