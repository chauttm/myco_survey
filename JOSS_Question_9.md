## Generated Answers (20 responses)

### Answer 1

Based on the research paper provided, the accepted six species in section Nigri are:

1. Aspergillus brasiliensis
2. Aspergillus niger (subdivided into six varieties and two forms)
3. Aspergillus tubingensis
4. Aspergillus acidus 
5. Aspergillus citricus 
6. Aspergillus luchuensis

---

### Answer 2

According to the paper, after applying various species delimitation analyses and considering practical consequences, a conservative solution was decided upon, retaining four species in the ATL (Aspergillus luchuensis, A. tubingensis, A. eucalypticola, and A. vadensis) and accepting three species corresponding to the three main phylogenetic lineages: A. niger, A. tubingensis, and A. brasiliensis.

However, earlier studies suggested a higher number of species in the Nigri series. Some sources mentioned up to 16 taxa, including three that belong to the current series Nigri (A. acidus, A. niger with six varieties, and A. citricus with two varieties).

The paper also provides lists of accepted species for various genera, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of all accepted species in section Nigri.

Here is the revised list based on the DELINEATE analysis:

1. Aspergillus niger
2. Aspergillus tubingensis
3. Aspergillus brasiliensis

And here are some previous lists mentioned in the paper:

* A. acidus (as a separate species)
* A. citricus with two varieties
* A. niger with six varieties

### Answer 3

According to the research paper, after applying various phylogenetic methods, including four single-locus methods and one multilocus method, 11 supported the recognition of only three species corresponding to the three main phylogenetic lineages: A. niger, A. tubingensis, and A. brasiliensis.

However, based on a conservative solution, the paper decided to retain four species in the ATL (Aspergillus Tubingensis-Like), including:

1. Aspergillus luchuensis
2. Aspergillus luchuensis var. indica (not mentioned as separate species but as a variety)
3. A. tubingensis
4. A. eucalypticola

These four species were proposed in the DELINEATE analysis, which convincingly supported that the series Nigri contains only three main species: A. niger, A. tubingensis, and A. brasiliensis.

Please note that this classification might still be subject to further research and revision.

### Answer 5

Based on the provided research papers, the accepted species in section Nigri are:

1. Aspergillus acidus
2. Aspergillus brasiliensis
3. Aspergillus tubingensis
4. Aspergillus citricus (although some sources consider it as a synonym of A. tubingensis)

Note that some studies suggest a higher number of species in the Nigri series, but these four are the most widely accepted based on the research papers provided.

It's also worth mentioning that some researchers have reported more than three species within the ATL group (Atlantic lineages), with names such as Aspergillus luchuensis, A. eucalypticola, and A. vadensis being proposed. However, these classifications are not universally accepted and require further research to confirm.

The DELINEATE analysis mentioned in one of the papers suggested that there might be four species within the ATL group, but this conclusion is still a subject of debate among researchers.

According to the provided research papers, the current **accepted species** within section Nigri are:

* *Aspergillus niger* 
* *Aspergillus tubingensis*
* *Aspergillus brasiliensis* 

Note that some previous classifications included more species.  The research highlights the need for ongoing taxonomic studies and the use of molecular data to refine species boundaries within this complex group.

---

### Answer 11

Based on the provided research snippets, here are the accepted species in section Nigri according to the newly proposed taxonomic treatment:

1. A. niger (with six varieties)
2. A. tubingensis 
3. A. brasiliensis

The number of species within this series has been reduced from a previous high count by molecular genetic studies, leading to the acceptance of only three species overall: A. niger, A. tubingensis, and A. brasiliensis. Other taxa like ABL and ANL have been classified under these or potentially recognized as single species each based on different methods.

The taxonomy is still considered somewhat unresolved and ongoing research might further refine this classification.

---

### Answer 12

Based on the provided snippets, here is a summary of the accepted species within section Nigri:

- **A. niger**: This species was subdivided into six varieties and two forms according to Al-Musallam (1980). Later studies have indicated that A. niger should be reduced in number.
- **A. tubingensis** is proposed by Hong et al. (2013, 2014) as being extremely industrially important.
- **A. luchuensis**: Also considered industrially important and requires further study for species delimitation.

The paper suggests that the taxonomy of section Nigri is still unresolved, with multiple species names competing for priority, and the number of accepted species needs to be reduced based on various genetic methods. Specific recommendations were made regarding which species should be retained in the series Nigri.

Please note that more detailed and recent studies might have identified or reclassified these taxa differently. The list presented is derived from the materials available in the provided snippets.

---

### Answer 13

Based on the provided scientific research snippets, here are the accepted species in the section Nigri (series Nigri):

1. Aspergillus niger
2. Aspergillus tubingensis
3. Aspergillus brasiliensis

These species were identified through various molecular genetic studies and a comprehensive analysis using different phylogenetic methods, such as multispecies coalescence models (GMYC, bGMYC, PTP, bPTP), GCPSR approach, and single-copy orthologous proteins. The research concluded that the section Nigri contains only three species based on these methods.

---

### Answer 14

Based on the information provided, the accepted species in section Nigri (series Nigri) according to the most recent studies are:

1. **Aspergillus niger**
2. **Aspergillus tubingensis**
3. **Aspergillus brasiliensis**

The list is summarized from the molecular genetic studies and taxonomic reviews discussed, which led to a reduction in the number of species recognized within this section. The previous classifications had identified up to six accepted species but were refined based on modern genomic and phylogenetic methods.

---

### Answer 15

Based on the information provided in the research papers, the accepted species in section Nigri (series Nigri) include:

1. **A. niger** - This is subdivided into six varieties and two forms as per previous taxonomic revisions.
2. **A. tubingensis**
3. **A. brasiliensis**

The paper mentions that the taxonomy of series Nigri is still unresolved, with some species like A. carbonarius, A. heteromorphus, etc., competing for priority in determining their status and relationships within the group. Additionally, it suggests a reduction in the number of accepted species from an initially proposed 35 to only three based on genetic studies involving various methods such as multispecies coalescence model (phylogenetic), genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) approach, and single-copy orthologous proteins analysis.

---

### Answer 16

Based on the analysis of the provided research papers, the currently accepted species in section Nigri are:

1. **Aspergillus niger**
2. **Aspergillus tubingensis**
3. **Aspergillus brasiliensis**

These species were identified through molecular genetic studies and phylogenetic analysis, which have resolved the taxonomy of series Nigri into these three main lineages. Earlier classifications included more species, but recent findings support this reduction based on intraspecific variability and widespread occurrence of the species.

---

### Answer 17

Based on the analysis of the provided research papers, here is a summary of the accepted species in section Nigri:

- **Originally Proposed**: Mosseray (1934) proposed 35 species, which was later reduced to 12 by Raper & Fennell (1965).
  
- **Revised by Al-Musallam (1980)**: Cluster analysis suggested at least seven species, including A. niger, which was subdivided into six varieties and two forms.

- **Kozakiewicz (1989)**: Further distinguished 16 taxa, with three species in the current Nigri series: A. acidus, A. niger (with six varieties), and A. citricus.

- **Molecular Studies**: Subsequent studies using genetic data led to a reduction in species numbers. Currently accepted species include:
  - A. niger
  - A. tubingensis
  - A. brasiliensis

- **Unresolved or Variable Species**: Several species remain unresolved, including A. luchuensis and others mentioned as unresolved.

The list of accepted species is supported by molecular data and delimitation methods, with some species still requiring further study due to intraspecific variability and limited sampling in fungal taxonomy.

---

### Answer 18

Based on the provided research papers, the six currently accepted species in section Nigri are:

1. **Aspergillus niger**
2. **Aspergillus tubingensis**
3. **Aspergillus brasiliensis**

These species were identified through molecular genetic studies and phylogenetic analyses, which support their classification as three main species within the section. However, it is important to note that other populations in the series may not yet be definitively recognized as separate species due to unresolved taxonomic issues.

Answer: The six accepted species in section Nigri are **Aspergillus niger**, **Aspergillus tubingensis**, and **Aspergillus brasiliensis**.

---

### Answer 19

Based on current molecular and taxonomic studies, section Nigri of Aspergillus is reclassified into three main species:

1. **Aspergillus niger** - This is recognized as a broad species encompassing various previously described varieties and subspecies.

2. **Aspergillus tubingensis** - A distinct species with its own set of characteristics.

3. **Aspergillus brasiliensis** - Another distinct species, contributing to the diversity within section Nigri.

This classification was supported by molecular genetic studies that grouped these species based on shared morphological traits and molecular data, leading to a more streamlined taxonomy. The initial detailed subdivisions have been simplified to three main species to reflect better-defined taxonomic limits.

...The following list contains the names of accepted species in the series Nigri and their synonyms. Illegitimate and invalid names are also included as some of them are still used in the applied sphere. This list builds on previously published lists of accepted species and their synonyms in section Nigri (Thom & Church 1926, Thom & Raper 1945, Raper & Fennell 1965, Al-Musallam 1980, Kozakiewicz 1989). Compared to previous lists, this list is primarily based on available molecular data. If this data is missing, the names are included in the sub-list of unresolved or doubtful names. One of the main goals of this list is to point out that the taxonomy of series Nigri is still unresolved and to stimulate further research to resolve names for which original material is available in the form of cultures or herbarium specimens. Some of these names may still threaten the stability of the taxonomy of series Nigri. Most importantly, some of the synonyms or unresolved names compete for priority...

...The taxonomy of section Nigri at the species level has been turbulent over time. Originally, Mosseray (1934) proposed 35 species. This number was reduced by Raper & Fennell (1965), who recognized 12 species and two varieties, and provided detailed morphological characteristics to distinguish among their accepted species. Al-Musallam (1980) revised the species limits using cluster analysis based on morphological and cultural parameters, suggesting at least seven species, including A. carbonarius, A. ellipticus, A. helicothrix, A. heteromorphus, A. japonicus, A. foetidus and A. niger. In this classification, A. niger was subdivided into six varieties and two forms. Kozakiewicz (1989), who drew her taxonomic conclusions from conidial ornamentation under scanning electron microscopy, distinguished 16 taxa, among which three belong to the current series Nigri, namely, A. acidus, A. niger with six varieties and A. citricus with two varieties. Early molecular genetic studies indicated that...

...The reliable identification of section Nigri species is of great importance, as evidenced by their diverse positive and negative significances for humans. However, there is an increasing number of isolates that cannot be satisfactorily classified into the currently recognized species despite using multilocus sequence data (Howard et al. 2011, Negri et al. 2014, D’hooge et al. 2019). This fact also resulted in the recent description of several cryptic species related to A. niger and A. tubingensis (Silva et al. 2020, Khuna et al. 2021). The narrow species definition in the series Nigri is also associated with unsatisfactory identification results of MALDI- TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry), a widely used identification tool in diagnostic laboratories and applied spheres (Gautier et al. 2016, D’hooge et al. 2019, Ban et al. 2021).

...We showed based on various independent species delimitation analyses that the number of accepted species in the Nigri series is too high and needs to be reduced. The methods broadly agreed that the ABL and ANL contain only one species each. The only uncertainty was about the species number in the ATL, where single-gene MSC methods and the GCPSR approach based on the commonly used phylogenetic markers benA, CaM and RPB2 supported only one species, while STACEY analyses supported up to four species: A. tubingensis, A. luchuensis, A. eucalypticola and A. vadensis. After considering all results and practical consequences, we decided on a conservative solution by retaining four species in the ATL. This newly proposed taxonomic treatment of series Nigri with six accepted species overall is shown in Fig. 10. The following findings played a major role in our decision-making process. Aspergillus luchuensis is industrially extremely important (Hong et al. 2013, 2014), and its imprudent...


**[5] C. Bian, Y. Kusuya, F. Sklenář et al.**. ***Reducing the number of accepted species in Aspergillus series Nigri***. **2022**

...A common requirement of species delimitation methods is proper sampling (a high number of strains of all studied species ideally isolated from a wide range of substrates and localities) and the presence of intraspecific variability (Carstens et al. 2013). This condition is, however, frequently difficult to fulfil in fungal taxonomy (Ahrens et al. 2016). From this point of view, series Nigri represents a perfect model group for studying species limits on a large scale due to the frequent occurrence of its species in many habitats and a high representation of molecular data in public databases. To do so, we have gathered extensive sequence data and applied a wide range of phylogenetic methods. The synthesis of the resulting data and the consideration of its practical taxonomic implications have led to a significant reduction in the number of species, as detailed below.

With the three- gene dataset, we employed phylogenetic methods based on the multispecies coalescence model, including four single-locus methods (GMYC, bGMYC, PTP and bPTP) and one multilocus method (STACEY). From a total of 15 methods and their various settings, 11 supported the recognition of only three species corresponding to the three main phylogenetic lineages: A. niger, A. tubingensis and A. brasiliensis. Similarly, recognition of these three species was supported by the GCPSR approach (Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition) and analysis in DELINEATE software. We also showed that the phylogeny based on benA, CaM and RPB2 is suboptimal and displays significant differences from a phylogeny constructed using 5 752 single-copy orthologous proteins; therefore, the results of the delimitation methods may be subject to a higher than usual level of uncertainty.

7 and 10 when A. niger was defined as a broad species as well. In models where the ANL was divided into four and six species, the unassigned ATL populations were segregated into four tentative species. This scenario is, however, improbable because the ANL was never divided into several species in Models 2, 6 and 9. Model 6 shows the situation where populations of the ATL are predefined into four species identical to those delimited by Models 3 and 4, while populations of the ANL are unassigned. In this situation, A. niger was also delimited as a single broad species. In summary, DELINEATE analysis convincingly supported that the series Nigri contains only three species based on benA, CaM and RPB2.
